### Are you a student interested in doing research with me?
If you are already enrolled at UCA, please get in touch with me to have a discussion about options. If you are not enrolled at UCA, but are considering coming here, I'm happy to discuss research ideas. **However, I am unable to guarantee any teaching or research assistantships as these are reserved for students who are already enrolled.**
